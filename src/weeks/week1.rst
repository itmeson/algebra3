Day 1
=====

Tuesday, September 6

 * Finish the toothpick problem
    * Can you work backward from toothpicks to level?
    * Can you make an expression that represents the entire pattern?
    * Can you make a graph that represents the entire pattern?
    * Can you construct a pattern out of toothpicks that has a different "rule"?
    * What do you notice about the rules the class is generating?
    * Why?
    * Can you construct patterns that break the rules?
    * Can you make expressions and graphs for all the patterns?

Day 2
=====

Wednesday, September 7

 * Exponent-ty patterns 
 * The textbook, homework, grading systems
 * Pair solving
 * It's all about reasoning -- make your reasoning explicit, and the problem will solve itself.
 * Group feedback on solving technique
 * Exponent rules and radicals.  Practice.

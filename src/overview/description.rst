Physics is a science that seeks to explain all of the natural world through the application of logic, experiment, and mathematics.  The focus of the class is on experiential learning, using curiosity to drive explorations of the physical world. Class time, assessments, and learning goals are all designed to emphasize the process of learning with the understanding that learning new things takes time and effort and should not be rushed.

Physics A is an algebra-based course that covers the essentials of classical mechanics at the college level -- motion, momentum, forces, energy, work, power, gravitation, and special relativity.  In every area we will develop physical intuition and reasoning about phenomena, learn new mathematical tools to describe those phenomena, and experimental techniques for probing the boundaries of our understanding. In addition, the class includes a computational component in which students learn to write simulations of physical phenomena using Python.

Students with an interest in physics, regardless of their experience or comfort with mathematics or with programming, should consider this class.  Physics is one of the most common core science requirements for many major fields of study.  The class will be an excellent preparation for future studies, to build skills and confidence to explore the world, and to understand the results and implications of new scientific developments.
